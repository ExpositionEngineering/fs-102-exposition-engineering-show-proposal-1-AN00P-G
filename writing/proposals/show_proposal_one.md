## 🎉 Show Description

I plan to start my show with introductions about the various things that will be discussed during the episode. It's not possible to include everything in a single episode, so I want to keep the show simple and sweet, with a touch of humor.

Starting the show with the daily life of an international about the adjustments and cultural shocks that are generally experienced. I plan to delve deeper into her past journey as an international student to know what the things are that we should do and what we should not do, and also what resources we have at Allegheny that will make our educational journey easier.

So, I just want to make this episode more of a guide for an international student rather than just talk about majors and minors. Although it is the main topic for our podcast, I think the International's guide matches the context.

## 📢 Call to Action

After listening to this podcast, I think that an International student will be able to gain a proper guide for their academic journey at Allegheny.
